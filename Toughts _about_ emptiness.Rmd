# The a wave is the colmination of 
# The c wave marks the start of the systole and represents the pressure rise inside the right atrium caused by the displacement of the tricuspid anulus ring

# I guess the a wave represents the atrium pushing the blood into the right ventricle 
# After that you have that fancy Tricuspidal Anulus movements leading to streching of the right atrium thus decresing its pressure (not sure about transmural yet, dont understand the concept for mow)
# Legalize it!
# pulse pressure has a lower and an upper end .. it is so far not clear what the notch in pulomnary artery pressure wave form means

# just realized that you can overline the pulmonary artery pressure graph and the central venus graph and allign waves and say fancy things that nobody understands
# what the fuck
